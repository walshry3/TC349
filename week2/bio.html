<h1>Ryan Walsh</h1>
<p1>		 Ryan Walsh is a senior at Michigan State University. He is currently studying Applied Engineering Sciences with
				 a concentration in Supply Chain Logistics. Drawn to the field of study by its complexity, Ryan loves to solve problems. 
				 While he has enjoyed increasing his analytical skills during his most recent internship at Jackson National Life Insurance,
				 he has also found the professional development of interpersonal communication to be a growing asset in the work place. Ryan
				 looks forward to building on his past experiences as he enters the Industrial Engineering masters program next fall at 
				 Western Michigan University.
</p1><br>
<p2> 		 Living by his fraternal motto to "strive for the highest", Ryan loves a good challenge. One of his greatest challenges 
				 and greatest accomplishments was his successful completion of four years in the Spartan Marching Band. As a baritonist and
				 trombonist he enjoys to practice and listen to music. In his additional spare time, Ryan follows up on local Detroit sports
				 teams and enjoys participating himself. As a former hockey player Ryan believes that competition is one of his greatest
				 motivators.

<h2> Critique of "panic.com" </h2>
<p3> The website panic.com is intended for commercial use. The site uses aesthetically pleasing pictures as links to its various products.
		 As a consumer I appreciate the fact that the prices for the products the site is selling are clearly stated. The videos that accompany the
		 product description pages are extremely useful. After watching for only a few moments I can easily tell the intended use of each product.
		 Furthermore, the ability to submit item specific questions to the website is a very user friendly addition. 
</p3><br>
<p4> In my opinion the site could be improved with just a few changes. First, I would include audio with the videos. The audio would better help
		 prospective customers understand the products. Second, if not audio I would like to see a short and concise written product description. Lastly, 
		 I would have liked to have seen perhaps bullet points describing why the panic.com products are better than the competition. Overall, panic.com was
		 a great site but could still be improved to better serve its audience.
