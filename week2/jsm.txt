	The website jasonsantamaria.com was a very interesting and useful site.
The site was very organized and easy to navigate. This was especially true for
two reasons. First, the new material that had been added to the page was listed
in chronological order by date. This would be particularly useful when using the
site as a reference. Second, the filter bubbles on the different pages of the site
made navigation extremely simple. Some categories were empty yet, but the site is
definitely built with ease of navigation in mind.
	As for the content of the site it was very collaborative and intended for
the common good of all web designers. I appreciated how many different articles 
with different topics and opinions were made available on the site. The author of
the site clearly states his intentions with the site and holds true to them.
Furthermore, I found the linking of specific books to purchasing clients to be 
a good way of making it as easy as possible to share the books he appreciated. 
	Overall, this aesthetically pleasing site was enjoyable to peruse and 
was full of easy to use links and informative articles.
