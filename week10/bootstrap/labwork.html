		<h1>Survey Results: Community Interest</h1>
		<p class="ind">In order to better understand what the community wanted, a survey was conducted by four engineering students from Michigan State University.
			 The survey, which can be found at a link at the top of the page, allowed citizens to categorize themselves by income level and then rate their interest
			 in having various industries move into the intersection of Clark and Webster. The target population for the survey was local families, and the majority
			 of the results came from the local elementary school. A total of 490 citizens responded to the survey, allowing the results below to reach statistical
			 relevance. Overall, it can be assumed with 95% confidence that the results accurately depict the opinion of the township as a whole, and should be
			 used to better understand the potential for customers within the community.</p><br>
