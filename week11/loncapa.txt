A site that I commonly use on my cell phone is “loncapa.msu.edu”. “Loncapa” is a site I use to complete various online homework assignments and occasionally check my course grades. Often, I find myself accessing it in class by use of my cell phone, and thus I depend on its mobile usability. Overall, I would say the site is decent on a mobile device but could be better for various reasons. 
	First, the site is built such that it shrinks to fit the screen of my cell phone. I appreciate the fact that I can see the page in its entirety, but the text is not nearly large enough. In order to enter my password to use the site I must manually enlarge the image. This is somewhat of a hassle, but it is nonetheless usable. Second, because the mobile site is the same as the regular site, I do not lose any of the features I wish to use. Occasionally mobile sites are “more concise versions” and lack various content, but “loncapa” does not fall into this category. Lastly, even though it isn’t the best on a cell phone, the mobile version is sized perfectly on my other devices such as my kindle. Although the mobile version of “loncapa.msu.edu” could be more user friendly, it certainly still gets the job done.
