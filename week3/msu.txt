Critique of MSU Home Page

After reviewing the MSU homepage I am proud to say that it represents my university well.
Compared to other institutions, the MSU homepage is very professional and aesthetically pleasing.
The university has gone through great lengths to unify its athletic teams with one definable 
shade of green. This same color is found on the website and certainly exudes a sense of school pride.
Furthermore, the statistics that flash across the screen highlight the best attributes of the university
and are very informative.

The utility of the site is also a strong quality. Convenience is the perfect adjective for this site,
as the multitude of links make navigation easy for prospective, past and current students alike. The 
diversity in content makes the page interesting and provides insight into the many facets of 
Michigan State culture. Lastly, the connection to social media made on the site represents forward thinking
and implies that Michigan State understands current communication trends.

This site is very well done and promotes Michigan State with a vim.
