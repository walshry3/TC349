	Overall I found the first week of class to be somewhat frustrating, mainly because 
of my text editor situation. Specifically, it was slightly confusing trying to work with 
"notepad" while the examples were done on a Mac text editor. However, after researching 
various text editors I decided upon HTML Kit 292 as the editor I would use this semester.
I chose this editor for a few reasons. First, the program was a free download and had 
decent reviews. Secondly, the editor came equipped with useful tools such as automatic 
highlighting and indenting. It also included auto completing to expedite trivial typing. 
The third and final reason I chose HTML Kit 292 was the option afforded to me by the program
to preview the changes I have made without having to save and refresh a browser. I believe
 that this will be especially useful when following along with future class tutorials.
	In a previous class I had been introduced to VIM. I found it to be a very useful 
editor because of the ability to customize many automatic features. However, it was also 
fairly complicated and not as user friendly for a beginner. As for Dreamweaver I was unable 
to get it to work properly on my computer. I am happy with the decision I made to download 
HTML Kit 292 and I hope that it proves to be a good decision throughout the semester.
