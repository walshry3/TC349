      <h1>Career</h1>
      <p class="C">Ryan currently just finished working as an intern for Jackson National Life Insurance. As a member of the Operations Analytics department
      			Ryan's main customers were other Jackson employees. Creating forecast reports and headcount calculators, Ryan was able to supply other
      			departments with tools used to make staffing and work load decisions. Ryan will look to build on these skills and apply them to a 
      			manufacturing setting in the future. Starting May 6th 2013, Ryan will begin a new internship in a crossfunctional role between the supply
						chain, industrial engineering and IT departments at Delphi Corporation in Troy Michigan. </p> 
      <p class="C">Entering graduate school next fall in Industrial Engineering, Ryan aspires to be in charge of work flow processes some day. Seeing
      			efficiency as a constant way to improve a companies bottom line, Ryan will look to help future employers attain success never before thought
      			possible. As an ultimate goal, Ryan would love to be a COO someday and is ready to put in the effort to get there. You can access useful information
