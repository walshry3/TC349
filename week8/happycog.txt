“Happy Cog” is a company that designs various websites for its clients. The “Happy Cog” site is aesthetically pleasing with its use of multiple colors while staying away from anything too bright. One thing about the site that I find useful is the fact that all of the content can be found on the index page. The links at the top simply bring you to the specific portion of the index page devoted to that topic. This feature ensures that prospective customers can access any needed information without having to complete any true navigation. 
	Another quality of the site that I find advantageous is the fact that the top menu bar stays visible at all times while scrolling up and down. It is nearly impossible to get lost on this site. I would personally like to add this particular feature to my own website. One more comment on the site is that its content is very impactful. By including such insightful examples of previous projects I quickly became acquainted with the quality of product this company produces. This is a great site that represents a great company.
