<h1> Sorting Results for Personal Site </h1>
<p>In order to record the opinions of others, I created the index cards using an online tool.
		The website called websort.net allowed me to create a free survey. The survey included
		a long list of items and a smaller list of groups. The groups represented the various main
		sections that I intend to have on my personal site. I decided upon the main sections based on the menu at 
		the top of my current site. These groups were "Welcome", "Academics", "Career" and "Hobbies".
		I explained to the other sorters that I wanted them to organize the items in the order that was most logical
		to them. I did not allow for items to be in more than one category, but I did allow for the creation of new 
		categories. In total, 5 people were surveyed. </p>

<p>The results were somewhat predictable. Many of the items only made sense to be in one particular group. 
			 However, the results were very useful when determining where to place new material. My goal is to have
			 my personal site serve as a place for prospective employers to learn anything and everything about me. 
			 Much like a resume though, organization is very important. An employer may only want to see a specific 
			 piece of information and I want to be able to predict where they will look for it. By having the sorters
			 place the new material including a resume, references, code samples, writing samples and goals among others
			 in similar groups I can be more certain that I have choosen the correct one. In all, I agreed with the item
			 placement seen below. Personally, I would be more interested in having a blog and quotes of the day on the
			 welcome page, but I am open to different ideas. </p>

<h2> Final Project Design </h2>

<p> For my final project, my goal is to create a personal website used to sell myself in the workplace. I want it to be
informative, interactive and intersting. It needs to be able to help me stand out to employers. In order to achive this 
it must be well organized and full of good content. </p>
