	Heroku is a website that uses cloud technology to deploy and mannage online applications.
The site is very user friendly and incredibly aesthetically pleasing. The top bar has links to all 
of the important pages of the site making it easy to navigate. Furthermore, the contact page offers 
an easy way to have questions answered by featuring topic dependent contacts. This way consumers are 
directed to the right people immediately.
	Another brilliant aspect of the site is the interactive diagram explaining how the site works. 
The diagram clearly demonstrates the relationship between user, data and the site making it much easier
to understand. The site also includes a pricing tool, which allows users to input the specs of their
application to receive a personal quote. Overall, this site was built with the consumer in mind and 
can definitely be used as a competitive advantage. 

	

	The layout that I chose for my personal site varied by page. The index and career pages used the 
double technique while the academics and hobbies pages used the gallery technique. I decided upon these 
methods for two reasons. First, I had been using tables to keep things centered and spaced, but using articles
is a more sustainable method. Second, on the two pages with the double technique I clearly had one main item,
with a somewhat less important side item.
	I added a footer to every page, as I thought it would be useful to have my contact information available
at any time. Also, I added a twitter feed widget to my index page. Unfortunately it is inoperational at this time, but 
it will be fully functional once my site has a host.
