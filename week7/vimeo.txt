	Vimeo is a website used to upload and share videos with other people. The site is aesthetically pleasing
due to the use of vibrant colors and the varying fonts. The animation on the front page is also a nice touch. The top bar
includes all of the useful links necessary to explore the site. Specifically, the secondary menu that is produced after
hovering over the top links makes navigation even easier.
	One of the best features of this site is the way it introduces its brand to new users. Included on the home page 
are various facts and links that describe why Vimeo is a great tool. Furthermore, it highlights what features make Vimeo better than competitors. Lastly, the overall decor of the website seems to be aimed at younger generations, which I believe to be its intended audience.
