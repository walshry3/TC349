When I first searched for the MSU mobile website, I did not remember to add the “m.” in front of the url in the browser. However, MSU gave me the option to redirect to the mobile site by clicking a button. This is a useful way of helping users get the most out of their visit to the site, and I certainly appreciated the reminder. As for the mobile site itself, the layout was incredibly simple yet effective. With only three rows of icons, all essential links were available to the user. Furthermore, the size of the font was large enough to read, making it impossible to not find where you wanted to go.
	Two exceptional features of the mobile site are the search bar and the customize feature. On nearly every link, including the videos tab, users are able to search content for specific information. I personally have found this to be a feature that is occasionally not included on other mobile sites and appreciated its presence. The customize feature is very unique, as it allows you to change what links are on the home page and in what order. Not only is the MSU mobile site useful, it is customizable! Once again, I am proud to say this site represents my school well.
