Chartbeat is a website that supplies various companies with consumer data as it relates
to the use of their websites. The service seems very useful and could be used to create 
a competitive advantage. The site was very transparent in that it spoke of its CEO and 
what makes the company better than competitors. Furthermore, the "real time" stats that 
it displays about "you" using the site is very unique and does a great job in showing 
prospective customers what Chartbeat is capable of.
Although the company seems very interesting, I have two complaints about the site. First,
I didn't find the display on the front page aesthetically pleasing. The jagged paper cuts 
that seem to seperate content made it bothersome to read. Second, I had to search long and
hard to find out what the company really did. Once I did find the link I had to go one link
further to learn what I wanted to know. Overall a cool company with a decent site.
