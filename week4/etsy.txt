	Etsy.com is a very successful commercial website. The site concentrates on handmade products.
I believe that some of the success is due to the layout of the site. The products are featured in vivid
pictures. The photos are well sized such that the products details are easily discernable. Also, the fact
that the prices are listed on the pictures is very useful for the consumer. 
	I noticed that the website is given a fixed position much like our lab this week. However, they do
have a mobile version of the site so that it still looks good on a cellular device. After this week's lab I have
grown to appreciate sites that are centered on the page like this one. Also, it is very aesthetically pleasing 
due to the large margins on the sides. Lastly, the borders and use of padding makes the block elements fit together
nicely. I also found it interesting that the site encouraged people to help add to the site and contribute content.
